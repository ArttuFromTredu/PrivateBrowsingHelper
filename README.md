# PrivateBrowsingHelper
A simple, lightweight Chromium extension that opens links in private browsing mode when set as the target in a link on specific sites. Useful for multi-tenant organisations with Microsoft 365 / Google Workspace corporate apps that require logins.

Don't forget to replace the placeholder in the manifest.json with your URLs where you want the extension to be active.
